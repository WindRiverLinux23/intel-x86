intel-rdk
=========
This feature provides support for Intel Runtime Development Kit.
Wind River doesn't provide RDK packages, please contact Intel.

1. Supported version
--------------------
v23.09

2. How to build
---------------
To enable this feature, please add the following configuration parameter:

    --template=feature/intel-rdk

Copy and rename rdk_klm_src_<branch>_<revision>_<date>_<commit>.txz to
${LAYERDIR}/recipes-devtools/rdk-tools/files/rdk_klm_src.tar.xz.

Copy and rename rdk_user_src_<branch>_<revision>_<date>_<commit>.txz to
${LAYERDIR}/recipes-devtools/rdk-tools/files/rdk_user_src.tar.xz.

Uncomments RDK_TOOLS_SOURCE in feature/intel-rdk/template.conf

Set following configs in local.conf:

    CUSTOMER_RECIPES:intel-x86 += 'rdk-tools'

3. File installation
--------------------
After the WRLinux image is built, the rdk-tools will be installed to three locations.

1) Libraries, header files, binaries and configuration files will be installed
to /opt/intel/rdk-tools on target.

2) Kernel out-of-tree drivers will be installed to
/lib/modules/<kernel version>/kernel/drivers/staging/intel-rdk on target.

3) Firmware in RDK will be installed to /lib/firmware on target.

4. Kernel out-of-tree drivers
-----------------------------
All drivers from Intel RDK tools are disabled from auto-loading. You can use "modprobe"
to load the driver you want, or change "module_conf_<driver>" in rdk-tools.bb.

5. DPDK with RDK
----------------
RDK tools should not be compiled with feature/dpdk. Since RDK tools depend on different
version of DPDK and do a patch on that specific version of DPDK, please refer to
rdk_readme.txt in RDK tarball for building the DPDK.

6. Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT)
-------------------------------------
RDK tools provide QAT kernel drivers. So feature/intel-rdk should not be built with
feature/intel-qat.
